## Abstract
Image generation combined with deep learning has become a hottopic these years. Inspired by the SinGAN developed by Shaham et al.,we implemented a new optimized conditional stack-GAN model, namedcSinGAN, in this project to explore some more potential solution on imagegeneration, and compare them with current models. In the end, our modelsees FID score improvement on 4 out of 5 image inputs.
